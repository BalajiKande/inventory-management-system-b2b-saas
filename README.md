# Inventory Management System for B2B SaaS

**Name:** Balaji Kande

This repository contains my solution to a multi-part backend engineering case study focused on:

- Code review & debugging
- Database schema design
- API implementation for low-stock alerts

The goal was to demonstrate **technical reasoning, scalability thinking, and real-world business understanding**, not just writing code.
